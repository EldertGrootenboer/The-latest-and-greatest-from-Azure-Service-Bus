# The latest and greatest from Azure Service Bus
As the program manager of Azure Service Bus, it is always amazing to share the latest developments of our service. It allows us get direct feedback from the community, and ensures that we are building the right product for your scenarios.

In this session we will have a look at recently delivered features, and what we are currently working on. You will get a chance to hear all about these latest developments, how we are building them, and why we made certain choices.

And who knows, we might even have a look at what is coming up on the roadmap! This will be your chance to see what is coming in the next months, and give your feedback which will help us give shape to these features.
